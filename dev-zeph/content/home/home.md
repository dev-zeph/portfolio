## I'd love to learn from you.


I’m always open to contributing to meaningful projects, collaborating with like-minded teams, or joining mission-driven tech organizations. 
If you’re working on something that makes a difference, `I'd love to hear about it!` Whether it's a project that needs a fresh perspective, a team looking for someone to jump in and contribute, or a charity cause that could use some technical or physical support—I’m just a message away.
