## 3rd job: Sole Developer

I led the development of Dalnotes, a centralized, open-source note repository designed to help Dalhousie students easily store, share, and access academic notes. While not officially affiliated with Dalhousie University, Dalnotes addresses a real need within the student community for accessible and collaborative study resources.

The platform was built using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Node.js, with the backend hosted on Railway and data stored in PostgreSQL. Notes are uploaded and downloaded asynchronously via AWS S3 to ensure performance and scalability. As an open-source project, Dalnotes invites contributions from the Dalhousie community, encouraging peer review and continuous improvement of the codebase.
