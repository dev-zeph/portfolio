## 2nd job: Senior Developer

As a Senior Developer, I led several key initiatives that significantly streamlined our internal processes and enhanced team productivity.
One of the most critical tasks I undertook was diagnosing and resolving long-standing issues with our CI/CD pipeline on Azure. The previous teamâ€™s documentation outlined persistent deployment problems, which led the Technical Director to assign me and a fellow Senior Developer to address the issue. I conducted thorough diagnostics, identified inefficiencies in the Azure deployment settings, and implemented comprehensive fixes. As a result, the CI/CD pipeline now operates smoothly, and deployments are consistently successful.
I'm also particularly proud of mentoring junior developers by guiding them through coding tasks, promoting best practices with Git, and conducting code reviews to ensure quality before merges.
