## 1st job: Junior Developer
The beginning of a great career. As a Junior Developer for Dalhousie Consulting Association, I had the opportunity to work on the DCA Website. Working alongside experienced senior developers and the technical director, I contributed to the company's core web application and learned industry best practices in software development. During the sprints, I designed wireframes utilizing figma and implemented the wireframes with React.js and TailwindCSS. I took initiative to create client facing content to assist in deciding the Content Management System to utilize - to which they eventually chose Strapi CMS. The senior developers assisted my efforts in integrating Strapi CMS for the clients while acknowledging their little technical ability. At the end of the project, we handed over a fully functional website, with content customizable by a seamlessly integrated Strapi backend. This project taught me valuable lessons in technical development and collaboration. I also participated in code reviews and daily stand-ups, gaining firsthand experience in agile development methodologies. Overall, through this experience, I built a strong foundation in software development and professional collaboration, setting the stage for my advancement to more critical roles within teams.
