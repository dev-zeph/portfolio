&lt;p>I led the development of Dalnotes, a centralized, open-source note repository designed to help Dalhousie students easily store, share, and access academic notes. While not officially affiliated with Dalhousie University, Dalnotes addresses a real need within the student community for accessible and collaborative study resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The platform was built using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Node.js, with the backend hosted on Railway and data stored in PostgreSQL. Notes are uploaded and downloaded asynchronously via AWS S3 to ensure performance and scalability. As an open-source project, Dalnotes invites contributions from the Dalhousie community, encouraging peer review and continuous improvement of the codebase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Job #2</title><link>http://localhost:1313/experience/job-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/experience/job-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="2nd-job-senior-developer">2nd job: Senior Developer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a Senior Developer, I led several key initiatives that significantly streamlined our internal processes and enhanced team productivity.
One of the most critical tasks I undertook was diagnosing and resolving long-standing issues with our CI/CD pipeline on Azure. The previous teamâ€™s documentation outlined persistent deployment problems, which led the Technical Director to assign me and a fellow Senior Developer to address the issue. I conducted thorough diagnostics, identified inefficiencies in the Azure deployment settings, and implemented comprehensive fixes. As a result, the CI/CD pipeline now operates smoothly, and deployments are consistently successful.
I&amp;rsquo;m also particularly proud of mentoring junior developers by guiding them through coding tasks, promoting best practices with Git, and conducting code reviews to ensure quality before merges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Job #1</title><link>http://localhost:1313/experience/job-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/experience/job-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1st-job-junior-developer">1st job: Junior Developer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The beginning of a great career. As a Junior Developer for Dalhousie Consulting Association, I had the opportunity to work on the DCA Website. Working alongside experienced senior developers and the technical director, I contributed to the company&amp;rsquo;s core web application and learned industry best practices in software development. During the sprints, I designed wireframes utilizing figma and implemented the wireframes with React.js and TailwindCSS. I took initiative to create client facing content to assist in deciding the Content Management System to utilize - to which they eventually chose Strapi CMS. The senior developers assisted my efforts in integrating Strapi CMS for the clients while acknowledging their little technical ability. At the end of the project, we handed over a fully functional website, with content customizable by a seamlessly integrated Strapi backend. This project taught me valuable lessons in technical development and collaboration. I also participated in code reviews and daily stand-ups, gaining firsthand experience in agile development methodologies. Overall, through this experience, I built a strong foundation in software development and professional collaboration, setting the stage for my advancement to more critical roles within teams.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
